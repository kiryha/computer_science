# **The Last Algorithm** — Movie Creation Brief
Cartoon series based on the CS theory ladder from “Computer Science for Kids”; education-first

## Introduction: What this is
A TikTok cartoon series that teaches **Computer Science fundamentals** as a **fantastic post-apocalyptic adventure**.

- The book provides the **CS ladder / source theory**
- The cartoon provides **story pressure + emotional conflict**
- Goal: **high-quality educational content** (not optimized for maximum views)
- Tone: **educational nihilism with heart**
  - cynical, absurd, smart jokes
  - but still humane and character-driven


### Non-negotiable guiding principles
1) **Education is the product.**
2) **Plot exists to force attention and memory.**
3) **No skipping fundamentals.**
4) **Humans are meaning; robots are structure.**
5) **Every abstraction has a cost.**

## 1) High Concept
> Post-apocalypse. Earth collapsed generations ago. Humans regressed to roughly **18th-century tech** (mechanics, crude electricity, basic chemistry/metallurgy) and lost the ability to rebuild advanced systems. Old World leftovers remain—**robots, machines, sealed devices**—slowly decaying.  
>
> The story takes place in the **ruins of Chicago** — a vertical graveyard of steel, concrete, rail lines, river bridges, and frozen lakefront infrastructure. Skyscrapers stand hollow. Elevated tracks rust above silent streets. Winter is a recurring antagonist.  
>
> Chicago survives not as one unified city, but as a network of semi-stable **districts** — Loop, Lincoln Park, Ravenswood, and others — each with its own rules, shortages, and politics. Trade, salvage contracts, and fragile agreements hold them together.  
>
> Our heroes live in one of these functioning districts and work as an official **search group**, sent beyond district borders to retrieve books, manuals, hard drives, parts, and relic devices from dangerous zones.  
>
> Each mission creates a concrete crisis that cannot be solved by instinct, force, or superstition — forcing the team to **re-invent the next Computer Science concept from the book** as a survival tool (starting with counting).

## 2) World Setup (Chicago + Tech Regression)

### 2A) Civilization state (after regression)
Primitive mechanics + crude electricity:
- gears, levers, pulleys
- steam and basic generators
- wiring, basic relays and coils
- basic chemistry / metallurgy

But lost:
- precision manufacturing
- microchips and the supply chain
- the ability to reproduce the “tech ladder” at scale

**World rule:**
> They didn’t lose “technology”. They lost the ability to rebuild it.

### 2B) Chicago — the functioning contract-city
Chicago is a surviving hub inside the LA ruins:
- organized city-state with **laws, contracts, rationing, and enforcement**
- **trade center** for surrounding districts
- salvage economy: parts, fuel, tools, batteries, books, storage media
- officially rational/pragmatic, but surrounded by myth and fear

Chicago’s operating philosophy:
> **If it cannot be measured, counted, verified, and recorded — it does not exist.**

### 2C) Chicago districs (the expedition zone)
Inside Chicago: fragmented ruins and hostile micro-societies based at pre-cataclyzm districs.
- many people **mythologize technology** as gods/devils
- **tech-superstition / techno-paganism** is common
- relic sites are treated as cursed temples or hunting grounds

Robots treat humans as irrational noise.
Humans treat robots as miracles, threats, or property.

### 2D) Geography / visual style
- Setting: **Chicago ruins**
- Visual reference: **withered futuristic city** (Futurama-adjacent)
- Architecture: far-future asymmetry; **concrete + metal + glass + tile**
- Many surviving buildings: **3–5 floor blocks**, connected by improvised bridges/stairs
- Most structures are broken or partially collapsed; relic infrastructure remains

---

## 3) Core Engine (Non-negotiable story logic)
### Episode engine (how story generates education)
> **Every episode = mission + crisis + invention.**

- The team is sent on a mission (contract from Chicago).
- The mission introduces a concrete failure in reality:
  - missing people, missing supplies, unfair trade, broken locks, night signaling, etc.
- The team must invent the chapter concept to solve it:
  - algorithm, representation, state, place value, binary, overflow, etc.
- The concept is demonstrated physically (props/diagrams).
- A misuse or shortcut creates consequences (“the cliff”).
- End with punchline + sting.

**Critical rule:**
> CS is not “taught because we want to teach it”.  
> CS is **reconstructed because reality forces it**.

### Mission alignment rule (book → episode)
> The episode crisis must reproduce the chapter’s **hook/metaphor** in-world.

Example:
- 1.1 Counting/Measuring → “shepherd problem” becomes “who returned alive?”
- 1.3 Binary → flashlight/switch communication required for survival
- 1.4 Overflow → fixed-size counters/locks roll over and warp reality

## 4) Robot Knowledge Constraint (required for stakes)
Robots are intelligent, but **they do not contain the full lost ladder of Computer Science**.

They are limited by two constraints:

### A) Domain locking (specialist minds)
- Each robot has narrow professional knowledge (logistics, comms, maintenance, etc.)
- They can solve **their domain problems**, but cannot lecture the entire ladder
- This prevents “robot Wikipedia” and forces humans to make conceptual leaps

### B) Memory decay (fragmented truth)
- Knowledge indexes are corrupted
- Modules are missing
- Memories glitch or contradict
- Robots may remember procedures without full explanation

**Robot world rule:**
> Robots can assist. They cannot restore civilization alone.

---

## 5) Big Idea: CS as a Fantastic Adventure
Each Computer Science concept becomes a **quest step**.

Not metaphorically. Literally:
- concepts are keys to operate relics
- concepts unlock capabilities
- each lesson upgrades their world

Core principle:
> Numbers don’t just describe reality.  
> Numbers become reality — and reality has cliffs.

---

## 6) Season 1 Overplot (Part 1) — **“Numbers Exist”**
Season 1 is based on Part 1 of the book.

### Season theme question
> **If numbers are inventions… why do they control reality?**

### Macro-plot
Chicago and the mission program keep nearly collapsing because they cannot:
- count reliably
- measure reliably
- store truth reliably
- run fair systems reliably

A surviving robot proposes:
> “Before we rebuild machines, we must rebuild numbers.”

### Reliquary (optional recurring season object)
A sealed Old World artifact (vault/tower/control console).
It cannot be forced.
It responds only to correct numeric thinking.
(Use if it strengthens continuity; missions still work without it.)

---

## 7) Conflict Model (high-level)
### Protagonist
A mixed team (humans + robots), rebuilding computation *without rebuilding old tyranny.*

### Core antagonist theme
> **Optimization without humanity**  
Efficiency becoming control / surveillance / dictatorship.

### Episode micro-conflict (required)
Every episode must contain one fight:
- shortcut vs correctness
- emotion vs logic
- “who owns knowledge”
- “who controls measurement”
- superstition vs proof
- tribal myth vs system truth

---

## 8) Episode format: **Episode = Chapter**
For this project:
- **Episode = Chapter** (one CS topic per episode)
- each episode must be standalone, but tied to the season overplot

---

## 9) Episode timing specifications (target: 5 minutes)
### Runtime target
- acceptable: **3–6 minutes**
- target: **~5:00 minutes**

### Required pacing (hard constraints)
- **Cold open joke:** 0:00–0:20  
- **Problem / stakes:** 0:20–1:00  
- **Core lecture + demo:** 1:00–3:45 *(education is the product)*  
- **Misuse / twist / consequence:** 3:45–4:40  
- **Ending punchline + sting:** 4:40–5:00  

### Theory vs story ratio
- **60–70% theory**
- **30–40% adventure**

Rule:
> If the episode works as a lesson without the story, it’s correct.

---

## 10) Script writing workflow (step-by-step, top-to-bottom)
Each episode must be built in stages (no “final script first”).

### Step 1 — Concept + Logline (2–5 lines)
- one-sentence episode idea
- one-sentence CS promise (“viewer understands X”)
- one-sentence ending sting

### Step 2 — Beat Outline (timestamped)
- 5-minute structure with timestamps
- no dialogue yet

### Step 3 — Treatment (1–2 pages)
- scene-by-scene prose
- what the viewer sees
- where diagrams appear
- exact CS points to cover from chapter

### Step 4 — Draft 1 Script
- full dialogue + actions
- complete episode beginning-to-end

### Step 5 — Revision passes (fast, surgical)
- **Education pass:** accuracy + clarity
- **Pacing pass:** cut fat, fit ~5:00
- **Comedy pass:** friction-based jokes
- **Visual pass:** every key idea has a prop/diagram
- **Tone pass:** nihilism + heart (no school lecture vibe)

### Step 6 — Final Script Package
- final script
- diagram directions (1–2 frames)
- caption-ready lesson summary (3–5 lines)

## 11) Main Characters
Core team: **2 robots** and **3 humans**.  
Characters full descriotion disclosed in **character bible** file.

---

## 12) knowledge transfer between GPT chats

Each episode gets its own chat.
In every new episode chat, user will paste (in MD format):
1) the **CS For Kids book** 
2) this **Movie Brief**
3) the **Character Bible**
3) the **Episode Brief** for current chapter

Then the model outputs Step 1 + Step 2 first, and proceeds only after approval.
