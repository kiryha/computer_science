# Episode production steps (per chapter / per episode)

1. **Concept + Logline** (2–5 lines)
   - One-sentence episode idea.
   - One-sentence CS promise ("viewer will understand X").
   - One-sentence ending sting.

2. **Beat Outline** (timestamped)
   - 5-minute structure with timestamps:
     - Cold open
     - Problem
     - "To solve this you need X"
     - Lecture+demo
     - Misuse/twist
     - Punchline+sting
   - No dialogue yet.

3. **Treatment** (1–2 pages max)
   - Scene-by-scene prose description.
   - Include *what the audience sees* (diagrams as actions).
   - Include the exact CS points to cover (from the chapter).

4. **Draft 1 script**
   - Full dialogue + action.
   - Still rough, but complete beginning-to-end.

5. **Passes** (fast, surgical)
   - **Education pass:** accuracy + clarity, remove ambiguity, keep the core definitions.
   - **Pacing pass:** cut dead air, shorten lines, tighten transitions to fit ~5:00.
   - **Comedy pass:** add punchlines where concepts create friction.
   - **Visual pass:** ensure every key idea has a simple on-screen visualization/prop.
   - **Tone pass:** nihilism + heart; no "school teacher" vibe.

6. **Final script package**
   - Final script
   - Diagram directions (1–2 frames)
   - Caption-ready lesson summary (3–5 lines)
   - Optional: shot list (if you need it for production)

## What the model should output first in a new episode chat

Ask for **Step 1 + Step 2** first:

- Concept/Logline
- Timestamped Beat Outline

Then iterate. Only after you approve outline/treatment, generate the full script.
