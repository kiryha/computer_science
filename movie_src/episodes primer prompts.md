# Episode Brief — S01E01 (Chapter 1.1)
## **Counting and Measuring (The Invention of Amount: Sheep & Pebbles)**

### Episode runtime
**Target: 5:00 minutes** (acceptable 3–6 min)

### CS goal (main product)
Teach why numbers exist before math:
- numbers were invented for **certainty**
- counting = **one-to-one correspondence**
- data representation: reality → symbol (“sheep → pebble”) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **state** as “frozen truth” (bag remembers) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- discrete vs continuous:
  - integers = staircase (sheep)
  - floats = ramp (milk) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### Story goal (adventure wrapper)
A settlement conflict erupts because humans can’t prove truth without counting.

**Problem:** someone (or something) is missing, but humans argue based on feelings, guesses, and superstition.

**Solution:** the robot introduces the first “counting machine”:
- a bag + pebbles + strict procedure (algorithm) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**Result:** the machine proves reality (missing sheep/person), forcing the group into action.

### Plot beats (high-level)
1) Cold open joke: humans treat “counting” as cursed magic.
2) Conflict: “Everyone returned!” / “No, one is missing!”
3) Robot: “You need a system. Numbers are not inside objects; numbers are inside *you*.”
4) Demo: Sheep ↔ Pebbles one-to-one + algorithm steps.
5) Twist: humans misuse counting to accuse/control (“math as weapon”).
6) Ending sting: Robot says the bag is the first hard drive — truth can be stored, but truth can be abused.

### Required visual / diagram
**Stairs vs Ramp** diagram:
- integers: ball on steps
- floats: ball on ramp

### Tone + constraints
- Education-first: **~70% lecture, ~30% story**
- Comedy + cynicism + heart
- No deep villain lore yet
- End with a hook line:
  > “Counting works. Next: how do you count 500 without carrying a mountain of pebbles?”
