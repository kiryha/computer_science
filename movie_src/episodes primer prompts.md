# Episode Brief — S01E01 (Chapter 1.1)
## **Counting and Measuring (The Invention of Amount: Sheep & Pebbles)**

### Episode runtime
**Target: 5:00 minutes** (acceptable 3–6 min)

### CS goal (main product)
Teach why numbers exist before math:
- numbers were invented for **certainty**
- counting = **one-to-one correspondence**
- data representation: reality → symbol (“sheep → pebble”) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **state** as “frozen truth” (bag remembers) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- discrete vs continuous:
  - integers = staircase (sheep)
  - floats = ramp (milk) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### Story goal (adventure wrapper)
A settlement conflict erupts because humans can’t prove truth without counting.

**Problem:** someone (or something) is missing, but humans argue based on feelings, guesses, and superstition.

**Solution:** the robot introduces the first “counting machine”:
- a bag + pebbles + strict procedure (algorithm) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**Result:** the machine proves reality (missing sheep/person), forcing the group into action.

### Plot beats (high-level)
1) Cold open joke: humans treat “counting” as cursed magic.
2) Conflict: “Everyone returned!” / “No, one is missing!”
3) Robot: “You need a system. Numbers are not inside objects; numbers are inside *you*.”
4) Demo: Sheep ↔ Pebbles one-to-one + algorithm steps.
5) Twist: humans misuse counting to accuse/control (“math as weapon”).
6) Ending sting: Robot says the bag is the first hard drive — truth can be stored, but truth can be abused.

### Required visual / diagram
**Stairs vs Ramp** diagram:
- integers: ball on steps
- floats: ball on ramp

### Tone + constraints
- Education-first: **~70% lecture, ~30% story**
- Comedy + cynicism + heart
- No deep villain lore yet
- End with a hook line:
  > “Counting works. Next: how do you count 500 without carrying a mountain of pebbles?”


# Episode Brief — S01E02 (Chapter 1.2)
## **Place Value (The Magic of 10: Buckets & Zero)** :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

### Episode runtime
**Target: 5:00 minutes** (acceptable 3–6 min)

### CS goal (main product)
Teach why place-value exists and why **zero is information**:
- Unary breaks at scale (“500 sheep problem”) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- Positional notation = symbol + seat (bucket system) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- Zero is not “nothing” — it’s a **placeholder that preserves structure** :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
- Base is a choice (10 fingers vs other bases) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### Story goal (adventure wrapper)
The settlement grows, and counting becomes impossible → trade/food/power records become chaos.

**Problem:** they attempt to track supplies with sticks/marks → arguments, fraud, violence. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
**Solution:** robot forces humans to adopt a **bucket ledger system** (ones/tens/hundreds).  
**Twist:** once the ledger exists, it becomes power: whoever controls records controls society.

### Plot beats (high-level)
1) Cold open: human accountant-priest draws 500 tally marks like a ritual.
2) Disaster: miscounted ration → wrong person blamed.
3) Robot: “You need compression. Put meaning in position.”
4) Demo: bucket table + writing 105 (“the empty bucket problem”) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
5) Zero enters as the “structural beam” holding numbers apart. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
6) Ending sting: numbers can now scale → control and oppression can scale too.

### Required visual / diagram
- **Buckets / place-value chart** (ones / tens / hundreds)
- A clear **105 vs 15** example showing why 0 matters :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

### Tone + constraints
- Education-first: **~65% lecture, ~35% story**
- Punchline ending:
  > “Congrats. You invented accounting. Now the universe can steal from you with decimals.”

# Episode Brief — S01E03 (Chapter 1.3)
## **Binary (The Switch: Flashlight, Relay, and Wiring Logic)** :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

### Episode runtime
**Target: 5:00 minutes** (acceptable 3–6 min)

### CS goal (main product)
Teach binary as hardware reality:
- 1/0 = on/off states (flashlight signaling) :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
- relay: “a switch pushing another switch” :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- relays → transistors (future hook only) :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- wiring logic:
  - series = AND
  - parallel = OR :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
- robustness/noise margin: binary survives imperfection :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

### Story goal (adventure wrapper)
They reach the Reliquary / Old World relic.
Humans attempt brute-force “magic”.
Robot insists the artifact responds only to **states**.

**Problem:** locked console/door needs correct two-state signaling.  
**Solution:** build a crude relay interface and transmit binary.  
**Twist:** humans think they “tamed the gods” — robot knows they only woke sleeping machinery.

### Plot beats (high-level)
1) Cold open: humans use flashlight as “holy yes/no oracle.”
2) Reliquary rejects analog input (knobs, prayers, yelling).
3) Robot: “This machine speaks in two words: ON and OFF.”
4) Demo: relay click-clack; signal triggers signal. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}
5) Demo: series/parallel wiring becomes decisions (AND/OR). :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}
6) Ending sting: the artifact activates — and something begins counting.

### Required visual / diagram
- relay animation: coil magnet pulls lever
- series vs parallel circuit diagram (AND vs OR) :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

### Tone + constraints
- Education-first: **~55–60% lecture, ~40–45% story/action**
- Final line hook:
  > “Now we can talk to machines. Next: what happens when machines run out of numbers?”

# Episode Brief — S01E04 (Chapter 1.4)
## **The Problem of Size (Limits & Overflow: The Number Cliff)** :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

### Episode runtime
**Target: 5:00 minutes** (acceptable 3–6 min)

### CS goal (main product)
Teach finite representation and overflow:
- hardware is finite (“sticky note problem”) :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}
- overflow = values wrap around (odometer rollover) :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
- number line vs number circle :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}
- bit width: 8-bit vs 64-bit range intuition :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}
- underflow / wrap-around story (Gandhi glitch) :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}

### Story goal (adventure wrapper)
They rely on the newly activated system (power/water/gate).
It works… until a counter hits max.

**Problem:** machine tracks time/pressure/charges with limited bits.  
**Event:** overflow resets the machine’s “reality.”  
**Consequence:** disaster (flood/fire/lockdown) caused by math, not malice.

Season purpose:
> first time the audience feels: “computers can kill by being correct.”

### Plot beats (high-level)
1) Cold open: humans assume “numbers can’t lie.”
2) System works; settlement celebrates rebirth.
3) Robot warns: “numbers are trapped in boxes.”
4) Demo: odometer rollover (999,999 → 000,000). :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}
5) Disaster occurs as real-world overflow.
6) Ending sting: robot points at the cliff:
   > “Truth doesn’t mean safety. Next we learn how numbers become letters.”

### Required visual / diagram
- odometer rollover visual
- **number circle / clock-face** with wrap-around arrow :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}

### Tone + constraints
- Education-first: **~65–70% lecture, ~30–35% story**
- This episode ends darker than others (season finale).
