## Workflow Overview
**Pipeline Strategy:** "Bake & Feed"
Stop treating Veo as a *compositor*. Use the Image Model to build the world (Bake), and the Video Model only to move it (Feed).

### Phase 1: Asset Generation (Nano Banana)
Generate the raw ingredients. Do not rely on one image per asset.

* **Character Kit:**
    * **Identity Truth:** Medium shot, 3/4 view (Face detail).
    * **Anatomy Truth:** Full body T-pose/A-pose (Proportions & Costume).
    * **Texture Truth:** Close-up action shot (Lighting & Material).
* **Location Kit:**
    * **Master Wide:** Establishing shot of the empty environment.
    * **Reverse Angle:** 180° view for dialogue coverage.
    * **Canny Layout:** Simple 3D blockout renders (edges) to force perspective if needed.

### Phase 2: The "Bake" (Pre-Composition)
**Goal:** Create the perfect "Shot 0" using Nano Banana's 14-image context window.

* **Action:** Feed your **Character Kit** + **Location Kit** + **Props** into Nano Banana.
* **Prompt:** Define the exact composition (e.g., "Character A standing left, holding prop, inside Location B").
* **Output:** A high-fidelity **Master Keyframe** where all subjects are already correctly placed and lit.

### Phase 3: Shot Simulation (Veo 3.1)
**Goal:** Animate the Master Keyframe. Use "Ingredients to Video" mode.

* **Input 1 (The Anchor):** Your **Master Keyframe** (from Phase 2).
    * *Role:* Sets the scene, lighting, and starting position.
* **Input 2 (The Passport):** Your **Character Identity Truth** (Face crop).
    * *Role:* Forces the model to maintain facial likeness during movement.
* **Prompt:** Describe the **motion only** (e.g., "Camera pushes in, character turns head"). Do not describe objects or colors; they are already in the image.

### Phase 4: Audio (Decoupled)
* **Voice:** Generate consistent dialogue in Vertex AI / ElevenLabs.
* **Performance:** Generate video in Veo with neutral or generic talking motion.
* **Sync:** Use an external Lip Sync model (e.g., SyncLabs) to merge the audio and video in post.
