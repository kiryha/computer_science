# S01E01: Chapter 1.1
The step-by-step story development

# Step 1 — Concept and Logline
### Counting & Measuring — The Invention of Amount

### Concept
After the first scavenging mission returns to New Angeles, the settlement nearly tears itself apart over a single question nobody can prove: **is one person missing, or is it just fear and noise?**

### CS promise
The viewer learns why counting exists: not as “math,” but as **proof technology** built from **algorithm + one-to-one correspondence (data representation) + stored state**, and why **counting (integers)** is fundamentally different from **measuring (floats)**.

### Ending sting
Maya refuses to accept “trust me” as evidence and keeps asking one humiliating question: **“How do you know?”**—until the adults realize their terrifying weakness: without counting, truth is just the loudest voice.  
The humans push the invention forward and the robots assist: Roberto formalizes the method into a strict procedure, Max builds the props fast, Warrior warns that systems become chains, and Hustler treats the crisis like a comedy show—until the method works and suddenly it isn’t funny anymore.  
They create the pebble-bag protocol: **one person = one pebble**, and the bag becomes the first **receipt of existence**.  
Final sting: a second crew returns hauling a mountain of identical spare parts—so many that the pebble machine becomes absurd and physically impossible. Roberto lifts the bag and says: **“We can count now. But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”** → next episode: **Place Value**.

### Logline
When a returning scavenger mission sparks public panic over whether someone is missing, Maya forces the settlement to confront a brutal truth: without numbers they cannot prove reality at all. Together with Roberto and Max, they invent counting as a physical machine—a pebble-bag **algorithm** that turns people into **data**, stores truth as **state**, and creates a hard “receipt” no one can argue with. But the first time the system touches real logistics, it hits a new wall: some truths are too large to store one pebble at a time.

# Step 2 — Beat Outline (S01E01 / Chapter 1.1)
## 0:00–0:20 — Cold Open (Vibes Are Not Tools)
- Hustler watches people exit a dusty corridor.
- Squints.
- “Looks like everyone.”
- Beat.
- “Feels like fewer.”
- Shrugs: “Probably fine.”
- Maya: “Probably is not a tool.”

## 0:20–0:50 — Mission Return
- First scavenger team emerges from ruins.
- Dusty, injured, exhausted.
- Leader: “Everyone made it back.”
- A kid in the crowd: “No. Someone is missing.”

## 0:50–1:20 — Crisis: Reality Has No Proof
- Crowd splits.
- Some trust leader.
- Some trust kid.
- Some accuse both.
- Voices rise.
- Warrior steps between two people about to fight.
- Roberto observes silently.

## 1:20–1:50 — Human Spark
- Maya: “How do you know everyone is back?”
- Leader: “I saw them.”
- Maya: “You saw dust.”

Silence.

## 1:50–2:20 — Pattern Recognition
- Roberto speaks:
  - “You have memory.”
  - “You have stories.”
  - “You do not have records.”

- Maya locks onto that.
  - “Stories change.”
  - “Truth needs a receipt.”

## 2:20–2:50 — Invention Proposal
- Roberto: “We make one.”
- Picks up a pebble.
- Holds it next to a person.
- Puts pebble in a bag.

- Max instantly starts copying:
  - More bags.
  - More pebbles.

## 2:50–3:30 — Physical Demo (Education Core)
- Roberto establishes rule:
  - When someone leaves → pebble goes in bag.
  - When someone returns → pebble comes out.

- Explains:
  - Pebble = data.
  - Bag = state.
  - Rules = algorithm.

- Maya simplifies:
  - “One human. One rock.”

## 3:30–3:50 — Counting vs Measuring
- Someone points at leaking container.
  - “We lost some.”
- Roberto:
  - “You cannot pair soup with stones.”

- Two props:
  - Solid object → pebble.
  - Flowing liquid → cup line.

- Roberto:
  - “Some things step.”
  - “Some things flow.”

## 3:50–4:20 — Tension: Systems Scare People
- Warrior: “Who guards the bag?”
- Hustler: “I volunteer. I’m extremely honest.”
- Nobody laughs.

- Roberto:
  - “The bag does not decide.”
  - “It only remembers.”

- Maya:
  - “Better than forgetting.”

## 4:20–4:40 — New Mission Setup
- Runner arrives.
- Relay station has spare identical parts.
- City needs them.

- Second crew assembles.
- For the first time:
  - Each person is paired with a pebble.
  - Bag tied shut.

## 4:40–5:00 — Sting / Hook
- Crew returns carrying huge pile of identical parts.
- Roberto tries to use pebble bag.
- Bag becomes heavy, ridiculous.

- Roberto:
  - “We can count now.”
  - “But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”

- Maya stares at pile.

Cut to black.



# Step 3 — Treatment  
## Cold Open — Vibes Are Not Tools

Dust drifts through a narrow concrete corridor between ruined towers.  
A small group of people exits the darkness.  
Hustler leans against a broken column, watching.  
“Looks like everyone.”  
Beat.  
“Feels like fewer.”  
Shrugs.  
“Probably fine.”  
Maya, sitting on a crate with a book in her lap, looks up.  
“Probably is not a tool.”  
Hard cut to title.

## Mass Return — The Spark
A wide shot of **dozens of figures** emerging from multiple ruined corridors.

Some arrive in clusters.  
Some stagger alone.  
Some merge with other groups.  
Some peel away into side alleys.

Faces covered in dust, cloth, masks.

Noise. Shouting. Crying. Laughter.

Someone yells:

“Everyone who left this morning is back!”

From somewhere deep in the crowd, a kid screams:

“No! Someone isn’t!”

People immediately start talking over each other.

“Which someone?”  
“I saw him earlier.”  
“You’re confused.”  
“I saw her fall.”  
“I saw him walk out.”

Our core team stands inside the chaos, half-lost in bodies.

Maya watches faces blur together.

---

## Crisis — Reality Has No Proof

Arguments escalate.

Two men shove each other.

Warrior steps between them.

“Enough.”

Hustler scans the crowd.

“Congratulations. We invented noise.”

Roberto does not move.

He observes patterns.

Maya pushes forward.

“How does anyone know who’s right?”

A man answers:

“I remember.”

Another:

“I remember different.”

Maya:

“So nobody knows.”

Silence spreads.

---

## Human Spark — The Question That Breaks Everything

Maya speaks, not shouting.

“Everyone keeps telling stories.”

“Stories don’t match.”

“Stories change.”

She looks at Roberto.

“How do we stop stories from changing?”

Roberto replies:

“You have memory.”  
“You have mouths.”  
“You do not have records.”

Maya thinks.

“Truth needs a receipt.”

Roberto freezes.

Max looks up.

---

## Invention — One-to-One Correspondence

Roberto kneels.

Picks up a pebble.

Holds it next to Maya.

Drops it into a cloth bag.

Walks to another person.

Repeats.

Max instantly starts tearing cloth, tying bags, collecting stones.

Roberto:

“When someone leaves.”

“Pebble goes in.”

“When someone returns.”

“Pebble comes out.”

He shakes the bag.

“This bag remembers.”

---

## Physical Demo — Education Core

Roberto lines up three volunteers.

Pairs each with a pebble.

**Diagram Frame:**  
Person ↔ Pebble  
Bag = container

Roberto:

“The pebble is data.”  
“The bag is state.”  
“The rule is the algorithm.”

Maya:

“One human.”  
“One rock.”

Hustler:

“So the bag remembers because we’re bad at remembering?”

Roberto:

“Yes.”

---

## Counting vs Measuring

Someone holds a cracked container leaking fuel.

“We lost some.”

Roberto shakes his head.

“You cannot pair soup with stones.”

He pours liquid into a cup with a line scratched on it.

Liquid settles between marks.

“Some things step.”

(taps pebble)

“Some things flow.”

(points to liquid)

Maya:

“People are steps.”  
“Milk is flow.”

---

## Tension — Systems Are Scary

Warrior crosses her arms.

“Who controls the bag controls truth.”

Hustler:

“I accept bribes.”

Nobody laughs.

Roberto ties the bag.

“The bag does not decide.”

“It only remembers.”

Maya:

“Better than forgetting.”

---

## New Mission Setup — First Real Use

A runner pushes through the crowd.

“Relay station east. Crates of identical parts.”

“City needs them now.”

Our **core team** steps forward.

Roberto pulls out a bag.

Pebbles.

He looks at Maya.

She nods.

For the first time in history:

Each team member is paired with a pebble.

Pebbles go into bag.

Bag tied shut.

They walk into darkness.

---

## Sting — The Next Wall

The team returns.

Dragging carts.

Carrying sacks.

Identical metal parts spill onto the ground.

Roberto opens the pebble bag.

Tries to pair pebbles with parts.

The bag grows heavy.

Awkward.

Absurd.

Roberto stops.

Looks at the bag.

“We can count now.”

Beat.

“But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”

Maya stares at the mountain of parts.

Cut to black.

**NEXT: PLACE VALUE**



# Step 4 — Draft  
## COLD OPEN — VIBES ARE NOT TOOLS

A heavy metal door strains open.

FRANK (HUSTLER) and MAYA brace it with their bodies, boots sliding on dust-covered stone.

Outside: SCREAMS. FOOTSTEPS. SOMETHING METALLIC SCRAPING IN THE DARK.

People RUN toward them.

Wrapped in cloth. Bleeding. Panicked.

FRANK  
Move. Move. Inside.

Maya grabs arms, pulls people through.

MAYA  
Inside. Don’t stop.

The last person dives in.

Frank SLAMS the door shut.

Maya drops a rusted bar into place.

They both lean against the door, breathing hard.

Silence.

Whatever was outside moves away.

Frank looks at the crowd filling the old church.

Dozens of people. Shaking. Crying. Holding each other.

FRANK  
Looks like everyone.

He waits.

Scans faces.

FRANK  
Feels like fewer.

Maya wipes grime from her hands.

MAYA  
Probably is not a tool.

Frank exhales a crooked smile.

FRANK  
Guessing built civilization.

Maya looks at the sealed door.

MAYA  
No. Guessing destroyed it.

Frank’s smile fades.

A small voice from the crowd.

A BOY, clutching a torn sleeve.

BOY  
Where is my mama?

Silence crashes down.

Frank and Maya exchange a look.

Cut to title.
