# S01E01: Chapter 1.1
The step-by-step story development

# Step 1 — Concept and Logline
### Counting & Measuring — The Invention of Amount

### Concept
After the first scavenging mission returns to New Angeles, the settlement nearly tears itself apart over a single question nobody can prove: **is one person missing, or is it just fear and noise?**

### CS promise
The viewer learns why counting exists: not as “math,” but as **proof technology** built from **algorithm + one-to-one correspondence (data representation) + stored state**, and why **counting (integers)** is fundamentally different from **measuring (floats)**.

### Ending sting
Maya refuses to accept “trust me” as evidence and keeps asking one humiliating question: **“How do you know?”**—until the adults realize their terrifying weakness: without counting, truth is just the loudest voice.  
The humans push the invention forward and the robots assist: Roberto formalizes the method into a strict procedure, Max builds the props fast, Warrior warns that systems become chains, and Hustler treats the crisis like a comedy show—until the method works and suddenly it isn’t funny anymore.  
They create the pebble-bag protocol: **one person = one pebble**, and the bag becomes the first **receipt of existence**.  
Final sting: a second crew returns hauling a mountain of identical spare parts—so many that the pebble machine becomes absurd and physically impossible. Roberto lifts the bag and says: **“We can count now. But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”** → next episode: **Place Value**.

### Logline
When a returning scavenger mission sparks public panic over whether someone is missing, Maya forces the settlement to confront a brutal truth: without numbers they cannot prove reality at all. Together with Roberto and Max, they invent counting as a physical machine—a pebble-bag **algorithm** that turns people into **data**, stores truth as **state**, and creates a hard “receipt” no one can argue with. But the first time the system touches real logistics, it hits a new wall: some truths are too large to store one pebble at a time.

# Step 2 — Beat Outline (S01E01 / Chapter 1.1)

## 0:00–0:20 — Cold Open (Vibes Are Not Tools)
- Hustler watches people exit a dusty corridor.
- Squints.
- “Looks like everyone.”
- Beat.
- “Feels like fewer.”
- Shrugs: “Probably fine.”
- Maya: “Probably is not a tool.”

## 0:20–0:50 — Mission Return
- First scavenger team emerges from ruins.
- Dusty, injured, exhausted.
- Leader: “Everyone made it back.”
- A kid in the crowd: “No. Someone is missing.”

## 0:50–1:20 — Crisis: Reality Has No Proof
- Crowd splits.
- Some trust leader.
- Some trust kid.
- Some accuse both.
- Voices rise.
- Warrior steps between two people about to fight.
- Roberto observes silently.

## 1:20–1:50 — Human Spark
- Maya: “How do you know everyone is back?”
- Leader: “I saw them.”
- Maya: “You saw dust.”

Silence.

## 1:50–2:20 — Pattern Recognition
- Roberto speaks:
  - “You have memory.”
  - “You have stories.”
  - “You do not have records.”

- Maya locks onto that.
  - “Stories change.”
  - “Truth needs a receipt.”

## 2:20–2:50 — Invention Proposal
- Roberto: “We make one.”
- Picks up a pebble.
- Holds it next to a person.
- Puts pebble in a bag.

- Max instantly starts copying:
  - More bags.
  - More pebbles.

## 2:50–3:30 — Physical Demo (Education Core)
- Roberto establishes rule:
  - When someone leaves → pebble goes in bag.
  - When someone returns → pebble comes out.

- Explains:
  - Pebble = data.
  - Bag = state.
  - Rules = algorithm.

- Maya simplifies:
  - “One human. One rock.”

## 3:30–3:50 — Counting vs Measuring
- Someone points at leaking container.
  - “We lost some.”
- Roberto:
  - “You cannot pair soup with stones.”

- Two props:
  - Solid object → pebble.
  - Flowing liquid → cup line.

- Roberto:
  - “Some things step.”
  - “Some things flow.”

## 3:50–4:20 — Tension: Systems Scare People
- Warrior: “Who guards the bag?”
- Hustler: “I volunteer. I’m extremely honest.”
- Nobody laughs.

- Roberto:
  - “The bag does not decide.”
  - “It only remembers.”

- Maya:
  - “Better than forgetting.”

## 4:20–4:40 — New Mission Setup
- Runner arrives.
- Relay station has spare identical parts.
- City needs them.

- Second crew assembles.
- For the first time:
  - Each person is paired with a pebble.
  - Bag tied shut.

## 4:40–5:00 — Sting / Hook
- Crew returns carrying huge pile of identical parts.
- Roberto tries to use pebble bag.
- Bag becomes heavy, ridiculous.

- Roberto:
  - “We can count now.”
  - “But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”

- Maya stares at pile.

Cut to black.

# Step 3 — Treatment  
S01E01 — Counting & Measuring: The Invention of Amount

## Cold Open — Vibes Are Not Tools

Dust drifts through a narrow concrete corridor between ruined towers.

A small group of people exits the darkness.

Hustler leans against a broken column, watching.

He squints.

“Looks like everyone.”

Beat.

“Feels like fewer.”

Shrugs.

“Probably fine.”

Maya, sitting on a crate with a book in her lap, looks up.

“Probably is not a tool.”

Hard cut to title.

---

## Mission Return — The Spark

The main scavenger team limps into New Angeles.

Some are bleeding. Some are coughing. Everyone is filthy.

Their leader raises a hand.

“Everyone made it back.”

The crowd exhales.

A thin kid near the back shakes his head.

“No. Someone is missing.”

Silence spreads like oil.

The leader turns.

“You’re wrong.”

The kid points toward the ruins.

“He walked beside me.”

People begin talking over each other.

“I saw him too.”

“No, that was someone else.”

“He turned left.”

“He turned right.”

---

## Crisis — Reality Has No Proof

Voices climb.

Accusations start forming.

Warrior steps between two men who are squaring up.

“Enough.”

Hustler watches, amused.

“Welcome home. Free paranoia with every trip.”

Roberto stands still, eyes scanning faces.

Maya pushes forward.

She looks at the leader.

“How do you know everyone is back?”

Leader: “I saw them.”

Maya: “You saw dust.”

The leader has no answer.

Maya turns to the crowd.

“Does anyone know?”

No one speaks.

---

## Pattern Recognition — Humans Push First

Maya thinks out loud.

“Everybody keeps telling stories.”

“Stories don’t match.”

“Stories change.”

She looks at Roberto.

“How do we stop stories from changing?”

Roberto pauses.

“You have memory.”

“You have mouths.”

“You do not have records.”

Maya’s eyes light up.

“Truth needs a receipt.”

---

## Invention — One-to-One Correspondence

Roberto kneels.

He picks up a pebble.

Walks to Maya.

Holds pebble next to her face.

Drops pebble into a cloth bag.

Then points to a man nearby.

Holds another pebble next to him.

Drops it in.

Max instantly starts copying.

He tears cloth.

Ties bags.

Scoops pebbles into piles.

Roberto speaks slowly.

“When someone leaves.”

“Pebble goes in.”

“When someone returns.”

“Pebble comes out.”

He shakes the bag.

“This bag remembers.”

---

## Physical Demo — Education Core

Roberto lines up three people.

Pairs each with a pebble.

Diagram frame:

Person → Pebble  
Bag = container

Roberto:

“The pebble is data.”

“The bag is state.”

“The rule is the algorithm.”

Maya simplifies:

“One human.”

“One rock.”

Hustler:

“So the bag remembers because we’re bad at remembering?”

Roberto:

“Yes.”

---

## Counting vs Measuring

Someone nearby holds a cracked container leaking fuel.

“We lost some.”

Roberto shakes his head.

“You cannot pair soup with stones.”

He pours liquid into a cup with a line scratched on it.

Liquid settles between lines.

“Some things step.”

He taps a pebble.

“Some things flow.”

He gestures at liquid.

Maya:

“People are steps.”

“Milk is flow.”

Roberto nods.

---

## Tension — Systems Are Scary

Warrior folds her arms.

“Who controls the bag controls truth.”

Hustler grins.

“I accept bribes in advance.”

Nobody laughs.

Roberto ties the bag shut.

“The bag does not decide.”

“It only remembers.”

Maya:

“Better than forgetting.”

---

## New Mission Setup

A runner rushes in.

“Relay station east. Crates of identical parts.”

“City needs them now.”

A new crew assembles quickly.

For the first time ever:

Roberto pairs each person with a pebble.

Pebbles go into bag.

Bag is tied.

People walk into darkness.

Maya watches.

Nervous.

Hopeful.

---

## Sting — The Next Wall

The crew returns.

Dragging carts.

Carrying sacks.

Piles of identical metal parts spill onto the ground.

Roberto opens the pebble bag.

Tries to count parts with pebbles.

The bag grows heavy.

Awkward.

Absurd.

Roberto stops.

Looks at the bag.

“We can count now.”

Beat.

“But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”

Maya stares at the mountain of parts.

Cut to black.
