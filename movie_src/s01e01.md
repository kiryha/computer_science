# S01E01: Chapter 1.1
The step-by-step story development

# Step 1 — Concept and Logline
### Counting & Measuring — The Invention of Amount

### Concept
After the first scavenging mission returns to New Angeles, the settlement nearly tears itself apart over a single question nobody can prove: **is one person missing, or is it just fear and noise?**

### CS promise
The viewer learns why counting exists: not as “math,” but as **proof technology** built from **algorithm + one-to-one correspondence (data representation) + stored state**, and why **counting (integers)** is fundamentally different from **measuring (floats)**.

### Ending sting
Maya refuses to accept “trust me” as evidence and keeps asking one humiliating question: **“How do you know?”**—until the adults realize their terrifying weakness: without counting, truth is just the loudest voice.  
The humans push the invention forward and the robots assist: Roberto formalizes the method into a strict procedure, Max builds the props fast, Warrior warns that systems become chains, and Hustler treats the crisis like a comedy show—until the method works and suddenly it isn’t funny anymore.  
They create the pebble-bag protocol: **one person = one pebble**, and the bag becomes the first **receipt of existence**.  
Final sting: a second crew returns hauling a mountain of identical spare parts—so many that the pebble machine becomes absurd and physically impossible. Roberto lifts the bag and says: **“We can count now. But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”** → next episode: **Place Value**.

### Logline
When a returning scavenger mission sparks public panic over whether someone is missing, Maya forces the settlement to confront a brutal truth: without numbers they cannot prove reality at all. Together with Roberto and Max, they invent counting as a physical machine—a pebble-bag **algorithm** that turns people into **data**, stores truth as **state**, and creates a hard “receipt” no one can argue with. But the first time the system touches real logistics, it hits a new wall: some truths are too large to store one pebble at a time.

# Step 2 — Beat Outline (S01E01 / Chapter 1.1)

## 0:00–0:20 — Cold Open (Vibes Are Not Tools)
- Hustler watches people exit a dusty corridor.
- Squints.
- “Looks like everyone.”
- Beat.
- “Feels like fewer.”
- Shrugs: “Probably fine.”
- Maya: “Probably is not a tool.”

## 0:20–0:50 — Mission Return
- First scavenger team emerges from ruins.
- Dusty, injured, exhausted.
- Leader: “Everyone made it back.”
- A kid in the crowd: “No. Someone is missing.”

## 0:50–1:20 — Crisis: Reality Has No Proof
- Crowd splits.
- Some trust leader.
- Some trust kid.
- Some accuse both.
- Voices rise.
- Warrior steps between two people about to fight.
- Roberto observes silently.

## 1:20–1:50 — Human Spark
- Maya: “How do you know everyone is back?”
- Leader: “I saw them.”
- Maya: “You saw dust.”

Silence.

## 1:50–2:20 — Pattern Recognition
- Roberto speaks:
  - “You have memory.”
  - “You have stories.”
  - “You do not have records.”

- Maya locks onto that.
  - “Stories change.”
  - “Truth needs a receipt.”

## 2:20–2:50 — Invention Proposal
- Roberto: “We make one.”
- Picks up a pebble.
- Holds it next to a person.
- Puts pebble in a bag.

- Max instantly starts copying:
  - More bags.
  - More pebbles.

## 2:50–3:30 — Physical Demo (Education Core)
- Roberto establishes rule:
  - When someone leaves → pebble goes in bag.
  - When someone returns → pebble comes out.

- Explains:
  - Pebble = data.
  - Bag = state.
  - Rules = algorithm.

- Maya simplifies:
  - “One human. One rock.”

## 3:30–3:50 — Counting vs Measuring
- Someone points at leaking container.
  - “We lost some.”
- Roberto:
  - “You cannot pair soup with stones.”

- Two props:
  - Solid object → pebble.
  - Flowing liquid → cup line.

- Roberto:
  - “Some things step.”
  - “Some things flow.”

## 3:50–4:20 — Tension: Systems Scare People
- Warrior: “Who guards the bag?”
- Hustler: “I volunteer. I’m extremely honest.”
- Nobody laughs.

- Roberto:
  - “The bag does not decide.”
  - “It only remembers.”

- Maya:
  - “Better than forgetting.”

## 4:20–4:40 — New Mission Setup
- Runner arrives.
- Relay station has spare identical parts.
- City needs them.

- Second crew assembles.
- For the first time:
  - Each person is paired with a pebble.
  - Bag tied shut.

## 4:40–5:00 — Sting / Hook
- Crew returns carrying huge pile of identical parts.
- Roberto tries to use pebble bag.
- Bag becomes heavy, ridiculous.

- Roberto:
  - “We can count now.”
  - “But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”

- Maya stares at pile.
