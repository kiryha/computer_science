## S01 E01: Chapter 1.1
### Counting & Measuring — The Invention of Amount

### Concept
After the first scavenging mission returns to New Angeles, the settlement nearly tears itself apart over a single question nobody can prove: **is one person missing, or is it just fear and noise?**

### CS promise
The viewer learns why counting exists: not as “math,” but as **proof technology** built from **algorithm + one-to-one correspondence (data representation) + stored state**, and why **counting (integers)** is fundamentally different from **measuring (floats)**.

### Ending sting
Maya refuses to accept “trust me” as evidence and keeps asking one humiliating question: **“How do you know?”**—until the adults realize their terrifying weakness: without counting, truth is just the loudest voice.  
The humans push the invention forward and the robots assist: Roberto formalizes the method into a strict procedure, Max builds the props fast, Warrior warns that systems become chains, and Hustler treats the crisis like a comedy show—until the method works and suddenly it isn’t funny anymore.  
They create the pebble-bag protocol: **one person = one pebble**, and the bag becomes the first **receipt of existence**.  
Final sting: a second crew returns hauling a mountain of identical spare parts—so many that the pebble machine becomes absurd and physically impossible. Roberto lifts the bag and says: **“We can count now. But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”** → next episode: **Place Value**.

### Logline
When a returning scavenger mission sparks public panic over whether someone is missing, Maya forces the settlement to confront a brutal truth: without numbers they cannot prove reality at all. Together with Roberto and Max, they invent counting as a physical machine—a pebble-bag **algorithm** that turns people into **data**, stores truth as **state**, and creates a hard “receipt” no one can argue with. But the first time the system touches real logistics, it hits a new wall: some truths are too large to store one pebble at a time.
