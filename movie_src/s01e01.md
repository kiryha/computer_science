## S01 E01: Chapter 1.1
### Counting & Measuring — The Invention of Amount

### Concept
After the first scavenging mission returns to New Angeles, the settlement nearly tears itself apart over a single question nobody can prove: **is one person missing, or is it just fear and noise?**

### CS promise
The viewer learns why counting exists: not as “math,” but as **proof technology** built from **algorithm + one-to-one correspondence (data representation) + stored state**, and why **counting (integers)** is fundamentally different from **measuring (floats)**.

### Ending sting
Maya refuses to accept “trust me” as evidence and keeps asking one humiliating question: **“How do you know?”**—until the adults realize their terrifying weakness: without counting, truth is just the loudest voice.  
The humans push the invention forward and the robots assist: Roberto formalizes the method into a strict procedure, Max builds the props fast, Warrior warns that systems become chains, and Hustler treats the crisis like a comedy show—until the method works and suddenly it isn’t funny anymore.  
They create the pebble-bag protocol: **one person = one pebble**, and the bag becomes the first **receipt of existence**.  
Final sting: a second crew returns hauling a mountain of identical spare parts—so many that the pebble machine becomes absurd and physically impossible. Roberto lifts the bag and says: **“We can count now. But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”** → next episode: **Place Value**.

### Logline
When a returning scavenger mission sparks public panic over whether someone is missing, Maya forces the settlement to confront a brutal truth: without numbers they cannot prove reality at all. Together with Roberto and Max, they invent counting as a physical machine—a pebble-bag **algorithm** that turns people into **data**, stores truth as **state**, and creates a hard “receipt” no one can argue with. But the first time the system touches real logistics, it hits a new wall: some truths are too large to store one pebble at a time.

# Step 2 — Beat Outline (S01E01 / Chapter 1.1)

## 0:00–0:20 — Cold Open (Absurd Failure)
- Hustler tries to “count” people exiting a dusty corridor.
- Loses track instantly.
- Says two different numbers back-to-back with confidence.
- Maya: “You changed reality in six seconds.”

## 0:20–0:50 — Mission Return
- First scavenger team emerges from ruins.
- Leader: “Everyone made it.”
- A dirty, shaking kid points: “No. One person is missing.”

## 0:50–1:20 — Crisis: Truth Has No Shape
- Crowd splits:
  - Some trust leader.
  - Some trust kid.
  - Some accuse both.
- Warrior: “Talking won’t find bodies.”
- Roberto observes quietly: chaos pattern.

## 1:20–1:50 — The Core Question
- Maya keeps repeating:
  - “How do you know?”
- No one can answer with anything except feelings.
- Roberto: “You are trying to store truth inside mouths.”

## 1:50–2:20 — Human Spark
- Maya: “Stories change. Truth needs a receipt.”
- Roberto freezes.
- Max perks up.

## 2:20–2:50 — Invention: One-to-One Correspondence
- Roberto proposes rule:
  - One person leaving = one pebble into bag.
  - One person returning = one pebble out.
- Max immediately starts building bags + gathering stones.

## 2:50–3:30 — Physical Demo (Education Core)
- Diagram moment:
  - Person ↔ Pebble
- Roberto explains:
  - Pebble = data.
  - Bag = state.
  - Steps = algorithm.
- Maya paraphrases in kid language.
- Hustler: “So the bag remembers because we’re stupid?”

## 3:30–3:50 — Counting vs Measuring
- Someone points at leaking container.
- “Count the water.”
- Roberto: “You cannot count soup.”
- Introduce:
  - Sheep = integers.
  - Milk/water = floats.

## 3:50–4:20 — Misuse / Tension
- Warrior: “Who controls the bag controls reality.”
- Hustler jokes about rigging pebbles.
- Roberto admits system can be abused.
- Maya: “Still better than guessing.”

## 4:20–4:40 — New Mission Setup
- Emergency call: nearby relay station has spare identical parts.
- City needs them tonight.
- Second crew assembles.
- For the first time:
  - Each person counted out with pebbles.

## 4:40–5:00 — Sting / Hook
- Crew returns with huge pile of identical parts.
- Pebble bag becomes absurdly heavy.
- Roberto: “We can count now. But numbers don’t fit in pockets.”
- Maya looks at piles.
- Cut to black.
