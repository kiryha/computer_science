# The Last Algorithm: Episodes Briefs 

## Episode Brief — S01E01 (Chapter 1.1)
## **Counting & Measuring — The Invention of Amount**
### CS goal (main product)
Teach the invention of “amount” as computation:
- **Algorithm** = strict recipe of steps, followed blindly
- **One-to-one correspondence** (sheep ↔ pebbles)
- **Reality → Data representation**
- **State** = frozen truth at a moment
- **Integers vs Floats**: discrete counting vs continuous measuring

### Story goal (mission wrapper)
**Mission return crisis**: a search squad returns to NA at dusk through a narrow checkpoint corridor. Visibility is bad, people are injured, some masked/covered in dust, one robot glitches ID recognition.

**Problem:** NA requires verification: *did everyone return?*  
No one can prove it. Panic starts. Accusations begin. The contract payment is frozen.

**Solution:** the team invents a **Pebble Machine**:
- 1 person = 1 token into a bag on departure
- 1 person = 1 token removed on return  
Bag = **state**. Empty bag = “all returned.” Leftover token = tragedy.

**Second pressure (measuring):** they also hauled back a leaking resource (milk / fuel / water). Counting containers fails → they invent **measurement** and explain why continuous values require floats.

### Plot beats (high-level)
1) Cold open: NA gate clerk tries to “eyeball count” people → fails hilariously.
2) Stakes: payment frozen; someone is “missing”; public turns superstitious.
3) Robot offers procedure, but memory is incomplete → humans must formalize the algorithm.
4) Demo: pebble bag system (data + state + algorithm).
5) Twist: bag not empty → real missing person (hook for next mission urgency).
6) Ending punchline: “Congrats, you invented counting. Now you can argue correctly.”

### Required visuals / diagrams
- One-to-one correspondence diagram (people ↔ pebbles)
- Stairs vs ramp (integers vs floats)

## Episode Brief — S01E02 (Chapter 1.2)
## **Place Value — Buckets, Carry, and Zero**
### CS goal (main product)
Teach scalable representation of large numbers:
- Unary breaks at scale (“500 sheep problem”)
- Positional notation = **symbol + seat**
- **Carry** as compression of state
- **Zero is information** (placeholder / structural beam)
- Base is a choice (short hook)

### Story goal (mission wrapper)
NA expands its salvage operations. A major run returns with **hundreds/thousands** of identical parts. NA requires exact counts for:
- rationing
- contract payments
- spare-part allocation

**Problem:** humans record inventory with tally marks like a ritual. It becomes unreadable → fraud accusations → near-riot.

**Solution:** they invent a **bucket ledger**:
- ones / tens / hundreds buckets (physical cups + written columns)
- live carry operation
- demonstrate **105 vs 15** → the empty bucket becomes **zero**

**Twist:** once records work, they become political power: whoever controls ledger controls food.

### Plot beats (high-level)
1) Cold open: an “inventory monk” drawing endless sticks until his hand cramps.
2) Stakes: missing ration supply triggers violence and scapegoating.
3) Robot (domain: logistics/inventory) introduces compression idea but lacks full system → humans build it.
4) Demo: buckets + carry, then writing real inventory counts.
5) Zero moment: “the empty bucket must be written or the whole structure collapses.”
6) Ending sting: scalable numbers enable scalable control.

### Required visuals / diagrams
- Bucket / place-value chart (ones / tens / hundreds)
- **105 vs 15** with and without zero
- Optional: odometer-style carry animation (quick)

## Episode Brief — S01E03 (Chapter 1.3)
## **Binary — The Switch, Relay, and Two-State Logic**
### CS goal (main product)
Teach binary as inevitable hardware reality:
- 1/0 = ON/OFF states
- Switch as bridge (open/closed)
- Relay: “a switch controlled by a signal”
- Binary place values (1,2,4,8…)
- Rob
