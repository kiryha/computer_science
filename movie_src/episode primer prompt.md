# Episode Template — **The Last Algorithm**
*(Copy-paste this into a new chat for each episode script)*

## 0) Episode Info
- **Season:** 1 — *“Numbers Exist”*
- **Episode #:** S01E__  
- **Episode Title:**  
- **Book Chapter Source:** *(attach CS for kids.pdf)* :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
- **CS Topic (one sentence):**  
- **Season Theme Question:** *If numbers are inventions… why do they control reality?*
- **Episode Runtime Target:** ~5 minutes (TikTok)

---

## 1) Episode Goal
### Primary Goal (Education)
Explain the topic clearly and correctly in simple terms, suitable for any age.

### Secondary Goal (Story)
Make it a fantastic adventure scene in the post-apocalypse that:
- creates stakes
- creates conflict
- ends with a punchline + a small existential sting

---

## 2) World Context (fixed)
- Post-apocalypse
- Civilization downgraded to primitive mechanics + primitive electricity
- Humans lost science; old technology is treated as gods/devils/forbidden magic
- Some robots remain functioning but decaying and unable to reproduce their parts
- Humans and robots depend on each other:
  - **robots teach CS / rebuilding tech**
  - **humans teach emotions / meaning / identity**

---

## 3) Overplot Context (Season 1)
### Season 1 Overplot — **“Numbers Exist”**
The settlement is collapsing because it cannot count, measure, store truth, or run fair systems.
The team rebuilds computation from scratch:
1) counting → certainty  
2) place value → compression  
3) binary → mechanization  
4) limits → disaster and humility  

A key recurring plot object exists:
- **The Reliquary:** an Old World artifact that only responds to correct numeric thinking.

---

## 4) Episode Engine (structure)
Use this pacing:

### (A) Cold Open (0:00–0:15)
- One joke.
- One weird world detail.
- Cut fast.

### (B) Survival / Social Problem (0:15–0:45)
- Something urgent breaks today.
- A conflict starts immediately (argument, accusation, danger).

### (C) Robot declares the lesson (0:45–1:00)
> “To solve this, you need: **[TOPIC]**.”

### (D) Lecture + Demo (1:00–3:30)
Keep **60–70% theory**.
- metaphor
- diagram explained through action
- 1 short example
- 1 short correction of misunderstanding

### (E) Misuse / Twist (3:30–4:30)
Humans apply the concept wrong, or apply it too well.
Show the cost of abstraction:
- precision becomes control
- counting becomes surveillance
- compression becomes manipulation
- etc.

### (F) Ending (4:30–5:00)
- punchline ending
- small philosophical sting (Rick & Morty / Futurama vibe)
- optionally tease the next topic
