# S01E01 (Chapter 1.1) — Concept + Logline

## Counting & Measuring — The Invention of Amount

### Concept (2–5 lines)

A scavenger team returns to New Angeles after their first mission. The leader insists everyone made it back—but a child says someone is missing. The settlement spirals into denial, superstition, and blame because nobody has a way to prove "same amount as before." A robot introduces a brutal invention: one-to-one correspondence, turning people into data (pebbles) and a bag into state (stored truth). They don't solve the tragedy yet—they invent the tool that will stop truth from being negotiated ever again.

### Logline (story + CS promise + sting)

When a returning mission sparks a crisis over whether someone is missing—and no one can prove anything—the team rebuilds counting from scratch by creating the "Pebble Machine": an algorithm that converts reality into data, stores it as state, and makes truth verifiable instead of political. They then face a second problem: some resources can't be counted cleanly at all, forcing the first distinction between integers (counting) and floats (measuring). 

**End sting:** The robot seals the pebble bag and says, *"Now you can count. Next: how to count big numbers without drowning in pebbles."*
