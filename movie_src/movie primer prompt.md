# Movie Creation Brief — **The Last Algorithm**
Cartoon series based on the CS theory ladder from “Computer Science for Kids”; education-first

## 0) What this is
A TikTok cartoon series that teaches **Computer Science fundamentals** as a **fantastic post-apocalyptic adventure**.

- The book provides the **CS ladder / source theory**
- The cartoon provides **story pressure + emotional conflict**
- Goal: **high-quality educational content** (not optimized for maximum views)
- Tone: **educational nihilism with heart**
  - cynical, absurd, smart jokes
  - but still humane and character-driven

---

## 1) High Concept
> Post-apocalypse. Earth collapsed generations ago. Humans regressed to roughly **18th-century tech**, losing the ability to rebuild advanced systems. Old World relics remain: robots, machines, sealed devices—slowly decaying. Most humans mythologize tech as gods/devils.  
>  
> The story takes place in the **ruins of Los Angeles**, split into two worlds: **New Angeles** (a rational science-utopia) and nearby **superstitious settlements**.  
>  
> Our heroes live outside the city, in a small settlement near NA, and work as a **search group** retrieving books, manuals, hard drives, and artifacts for New Angeles. Each mission forces them to rebuild computation from scratch—**one CS concept per episode**, starting with numbers.

### Dual-education engine (core relationship)
- **Robots teach humans CS** (structure, logic, technology)
- **Humans teach robots emotional intelligence** (meaning, identity, ethics)

They rebuild:
- civilization (hardware + systems)
- themselves (purpose + humanity)

---

## 2) World Setup (Los Angeles + Tech Regression)

### 2A) Civilization state (after regression)
Primitive mechanics + crude electricity:
- gears, levers, pulleys
- steam and basic generators
- wiring, basic relays and coils
- basic chemistry / metallurgy

But lost:
- precision manufacturing
- microchips and the supply chain
- the ability to reproduce the “tech ladder”

World rule:
> They didn’t lose “technology”. They lost the ability to rebuild it.

### 2B) Outside settlements (default human reality)
Humans are superstitious about tech:
- “cursed machines”
- “forbidden numbers”
- technogods / technodevils
- rituals replacing engineering

Computers are not understood at all:
> Knowledge of computation is essentially gone — rebuilding it is the entire educational arc of the series.

Robots treat humans as irrational noise.
Humans treat robots as miracles, threats, or property.

### 2C) Geography / visual style
- Setting: **Los Angeles ruins**
- Visual reference: **withered futuristic city** (Futurama-adjacent)
- Architecture: far-future asymmetry; **concrete + metal + glass + tile**
- Most buildings are broken or partially collapsed; relic infrastructure remains

### 2D) New Angeles (NA) — science city (context, not the heroes’ home)
New Angeles is a major city inside LA:
- rational and scientific (no religion in official culture)
- **science is absolute**; education is part of science
- open, progressive, peaceful
- high quality of life + medicine due to knowledge
- trades with settlements and contracts work to them
- feared by outsiders with superstitious dread

Hidden negatives (utopian but not perfect):
1) **Emotional sterilization**: stability reduces passion.
2) **Meaning vacuum**: science solves “how,” not “why” → quiet existential emptiness.
3) **Fragility**: depends on continuous learning/maintenance; entropy is a constant threat.
4) **Optimization pressure**: cultural expectation to be useful/measureable; creates marginals.

### 2E) Hero settlement (primary human environment)
Main characters live in a small settlement near NA:
- population: **a few hundred**
- former LA district (not suburbia)
- many surviving mid-rise buildings (**3–5 floors**)
- culture is superstitious with weak baseline education and no CS literacy

---

## 3) Big Idea: CS as a Fantastic Adventure
Each Computer Science concept becomes a **quest step**.

Not metaphorically. Literally:
- concepts are keys to operate relics
- concepts unlock capabilities
- each lesson upgrades their world

Core principle:
> Numbers don’t just describe reality.  
> Numbers become reality — and reality has cliffs.

---

## 4) Season 1 Overplot (Part 1) — **“Numbers Exist”**
Season 1 is based on Part 1 of the book.

### Season theme question
> **If numbers are inventions… why do they control reality?**

### Macro-plot
The hero settlement collapses because it cannot:
- count reliably
- measure reliably
- store truth reliably
- run fair systems reliably

A surviving robot proposes:
> “Before we rebuild machines, we must rebuild numbers.”

### Reliquary (recurring season object)
A sealed Old World artifact (vault/tower/control console).
It cannot be forced.
It responds only to correct numeric thinking.

---

## 5) Conflict Model (high-level)
### Protagonist
A mixed team (humans + robots), rebuilding computation *without rebuilding old tyranny.*

### Core antagonist theme
> **Optimization without humanity**  
Efficiency becoming control / surveillance / dictatorship.

### Episode micro-conflict
Every episode must contain one fight:
- shortcut vs correctness
- emotion vs logic
- “who owns knowledge”
- “who controls measurement”
- superstition vs proof
- tribal myth vs scientific explanation

---

## 6) Episode format: **Episode = Chapter**
For this project:
- **Episode = Chapter** (one CS topic per episode)
- each episode must be standalone, but tied to the season overplot

---

## 7) Episode timing specifications (target: 5 minutes)
### Runtime target
- acceptable: **3–6 minutes**
- target: **~5:00 minutes**

### Required pacing (hard constraints)
- **Cold open joke:** 0:00–0:20  
- **Problem / stakes:** 0:20–1:00  
- **Core lecture + demo:** 1:00–3:45 *(education is the product)*  
- **Misuse / twist / consequence:** 3:45–4:40  
- **Ending punchline + sting:** 4:40–5:00  

### Theory vs story ratio
- **60–70% theory**
- **30–40% adventure**

Rule:
> If the episode works as a lesson without the story, it’s correct.

---

## 8) Script writing workflow (step-by-step, top-to-bottom)
Each episode must be built in stages (no “final script first”).

### Step 1 — Concept + Logline (2–5 lines)
- one-sentence episode idea
- one-sentence CS promise (“viewer understands X”)
- one-sentence ending sting

### Step 2 — Beat Outline (timestamped)
- 5-minute structure with timestamps
- no dialogue yet

### Step 3 — Treatment (1–2 pages)
- scene-by-scene prose
- what the viewer sees
- where diagrams appear
- exact CS points to cover from chapter

### Step 4 — Draft 1 Script
- full dialogue + actions
- complete episode beginning-to-end

### Step 5 — Revision passes (fast, surgical)
- **Education pass:** accuracy + clarity
- **Pacing pass:** cut fat, fit ~5:00
- **Comedy pass:** friction-based jokes
- **Visual pass:** every key idea has a prop/diagram
- **Tone pass:** nihilism + heart (no school lecture vibe)

### Step 6 — Final Script Package
- final script
- diagram directions (1–2 frames)
- caption-ready lesson summary (3–5 lines)

---

## 9) Main Characters (placeholder; built in separate thread)
Core team:
- **2 robots**
- **3 humans**

Each character profile must include:
- role in the search group
- flaw (comedy + conflict generator)
- what they learn in Season 1
- relationship to NA (fear / envy / loyalty / resentment)

---

## 10) How episode chats will work (knowledge transfer)
This chat = **Thread B** (series plot bible)

Each episode gets its own chat.
In every new episode chat, user will paste:
1) the **book content as MD** 
2) this **Movie Brief**
3) the **Episode Brief** (short, chapter-specific)

Then the model outputs Step 1 + Step 2 first, and proceeds only after approval.

---

## 11) Guiding principles (non-negotiable)
1) **Education is the product.**
2) **Plot exists to force attention and memory.**
3) **No skipping fundamentals.**
4) **Humans are meaning; robots are structure.**
5) **Every abstraction has a cost.**
