# Movie Creation Brief — **The Last Algorithm**
Cartoon series based on the CS theory ladder from “Computer Science for Kids”; education-first

## 0) What this is
A TikTok cartoon series that teaches **Computer Science fundamentals** as a **fantastic post-apocalyptic adventure**.

- The book provides the **CS ladder / source theory**
- The cartoon provides **story pressure + emotional conflict**
- Goal: **high-quality educational content** (not optimized for maximum views)
- Tone: **educational nihilism with heart**
  - cynical, absurd, smart jokes
  - but still humane and character-driven

---

## 1) High Concept
> Post-apocalypse. Humans survived but forgot science. They treat Old World technology like gods/devils. A few robots survived too—still intelligent, but decaying and unable to reproduce their own parts. Humans and robots form an uneasy alliance to rebuild civilization by rebuilding computation from scratch, one concept per episode—starting from numbers.

### Dual-education engine (core relationship)
- **Robots teach humans CS** (structure, logic, technology)
- **Humans teach robots emotional intelligence** (meaning, identity, ethics)

They rebuild:
- civilization (hardware + systems)
- themselves (purpose + humanity)

---

## 2) World Setup (Tech Regression)
### Civilization state
Primitive mechanics + primitive electricity:
- gears, levers, crude generators, wiring, basic relays
But lost:
- precision manufacturing
- microchips and the supply chain
- “how to reproduce the ladder”

World rule:
> They didn’t lose “technology”. They lost the ability to rebuild it.

### Culture
Humans are superstitious about tech:
- “cursed machines”
- “forbidden numbers”
- technogods / technodevils

Robots treat humans as irrational noise.
Humans treat robots as miracles, threats, or property.

---

## 3) Big Idea: CS as a Fantastic Adventure
Each Computer Science concept becomes a **quest step**.

Not metaphorically. Literally:
- concepts are keys to operate relics
- concepts unlock capabilities
- each lesson upgrades their world

Core principle:
> Numbers don’t just describe reality.  
> Numbers become reality — and reality has cliffs.

---

## 4) Season 1 Overplot (Part 1) — **“Numbers Exist”**
Season 1 is based on Part 1 of the book.

### Season theme question
> **If numbers are inventions… why do they control reality?**

### Macro-plot
The settlement collapses because it cannot:
- count reliably
- measure reliably
- store truth reliably
- run fair systems reliably

A surviving robot proposes:
> “Before we rebuild machines, we must rebuild numbers.”

### Reliquary (recurring season object)
A sealed Old World artifact (vault/tower/control console).
It cannot be forced.
It responds only to correct numeric thinking.

---

## 5) Conflict Model (high-level)
### Protagonist
The mixed team (humans + robots), rebuilding computation *without rebuilding old tyranny.*

### Core antagonist theme
> **Optimization without humanity**  
Efficiency becoming control / surveillance / dictatorship.

### Episode micro-conflict
Every episode must contain one fight:
- shortcut vs correctness
- emotion vs logic
- “who owns knowledge”
- “who controls measurement”

---

## 6) Episode format: **Episode = Chapter**
For this project:
- **Episode = Chapter** (one CS topic per episode)
- each episode must be standalone, but tied to the season overplot

---

## 7) Episode timing specifications (target: 5 minutes)
### Runtime target
- acceptable: **3–6 minutes**
- target: **~5:00 minutes**

### Required pacing (hard constraints)
- **Cold open joke:** 0:00–0:20  
- **Problem / stakes:** 0:20–1:00  
- **Core lecture + demo:** 1:00–3:45 *(education is the product)*  
- **Misuse / twist / consequence:** 3:45–4:40  
- **Ending punchline + sting:** 4:40–5:00  

### Theory vs story ratio
- **60–70% theory**
- **30–40% adventure**

Rule:
> If the episode works as a lesson without the story, it’s correct.

---

## 8) Script writing workflow (step-by-step, top-to-bottom)
Each episode must be built in stages (no “final script first”).

### Step 1 — Concept + Logline (2–5 lines)
- one-sentence episode idea
- one-sentence CS promise (“viewer understands X”)
- one-sentence ending sting

### Step 2 — Beat Outline (timestamped)
- 5-minute structure with timestamps
- no dialogue yet

### Step 3 — Treatment (1–2 pages)
- scene-by-scene prose
- what the viewer sees
- where diagrams appear
- exact CS points to cover from chapter

### Step 4 — Draft 1 Script
- full dialogue + actions
- complete episode beginning-to-end

### Step 5 — Revision passes (fast, surgical)
- **Education pass:** accuracy + clarity
- **Pacing pass:** cut fat, fit ~5:00
- **Comedy pass:** friction-based jokes
- **Visual pass:** every key idea has a prop/diagram
- **Tone pass:** nihilism + heart (no school lecture vibe)

### Step 6 — Final Script Package
- final script
- diagram directions (1–2 frames)
- caption-ready lesson summary (3–5 lines)

## 9) How episode chats will work (knowledge transfer)
This chat = **Thread B** (series plot bible)

Each episode gets its own chat.
In every new episode chat, user will paste:
1) the **book contend as MD** 
2) this **Movie Brief**
3) the **Episode Brief** (short, chapter-specific)

Then the model outputs Step 1 + Step 2 first, and proceeds only after approval.

---

## 10) Guiding principles (non-negotiable)
1) **Education is the product.**
2) **Plot exists to force attention and memory.**
3) **No skipping fundamentals.**
4) **Humans are meaning; robots are structure.**
5) **Every abstraction has a cost.**
