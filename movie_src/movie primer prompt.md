# Movie Creation Brief — **The Last Algorithm**
Cartoon series based on the CS theory ladder from “Computer Science for Kids”; education-first

## 0) What this is
A TikTok cartoon series that teaches **Computer Science fundamentals** as a **fantastic post-apocalyptic adventure**.

- The book provides the **CS ladder / source theory**
- The cartoon provides **story pressure + emotional conflict**
- Goal: **high-quality educational content** (not optimized for maximum views)
- Tone: **educational nihilism with heart**
  - cynical, absurd, smart jokes
  - but still humane and character-driven

## 1) High Concept
> Post-apocalypse. Earth collapsed generations ago. Humans regressed to roughly **18th-century tech** (mechanics, crude electricity, basic chemistry/metallurgy) and lost the ability to rebuild advanced systems. Old World leftovers remain—**robots, machines, sealed devices**—slowly decaying.  
>
> The story takes place in the **ruins of Los Angeles**, where most surviving technology has become incomprehensible relic matter: powerful, dangerous, and half-broken.  
>
> Inside LA exists **New Angeles (NA)** — a functioning contract-city built among the ruins. NA is not a “high-tech paradise”; it is a **survivor hub with rules**, where trade, bureaucracy, and salvage logistics replace chaos.  
>
> Our heroes **live in New Angeles** and work as an official **search group** sent outside the city to retrieve books, manuals, hard drives, parts, and artifacts. Each mission creates a concrete crisis that cannot be solved by instinct or superstition — forcing the team to **re-invent the next Computer Science concept from the book** as a survival tool (starting with counting).


### Core series engine
- **Every episode = a mission**
- **Every mission creates a survival/business problem**
- The chapter concept is the *only* tool that solves the problem
- Therefore CS is not “taught” — it is **invented under pressure**

### Dual-education engine (core relationship)
- **Robots teach humans CS** (structure, logic, technology)
- **Humans teach robots emotional intelligence** (meaning, identity, ethics)

They rebuild:
- civilization (hardware + systems)
- themselves (purpose + humanity)

---

## 2) World Setup (Los Angeles + Tech Regression)

### 2A) Civilization state (after regression)
Primitive mechanics + crude electricity:
- gears, levers, pulleys
- steam and basic generators
- wiring, basic relays and coils
- basic chemistry / metallurgy

But lost:
- precision manufacturing
- microchips and the supply chain
- the ability to reproduce the “tech ladder” at scale

World rule:
> They didn’t lose “technology”. They lost the ability to rebuild it.

### 2B) New Angeles (NA) — the functioning contract-city
New Angeles is a major surviving hub within the LA ruins:
- organized city-state with **laws, contracts, rationing, and enforcement**
- **trade center** for surrounding districts
- runs on salvage economy: parts, fuel, books, tools, batteries
- officially rational/pragmatic, but surrounded by myth and fear
- citizens are more educated than average, yet **Computer Science is still effectively lost** as a coherent ladder (no infrastructure, no reproducible toolchain)

NA’s defining rule:
> **Proof matters.**


Purpose in story:
> It provides mission structure and stakes without breaking the world’s ignorance.

---

## 3) Big Idea: CS as a Fantastic Adventure
Each Computer Science concept becomes a **quest step**.

Not metaphorically. Literally:
- concepts are keys to operate relics
- concepts unlock capabilities
- each lesson upgrades their world

Core principle:
> Numbers don’t just describe reality.  
> Numbers become reality — and reality has cliffs.

---

## 4) Season 1 Overplot (Part 1) — **“Numbers Exist”**
Season 1 is based on Part 1 of the book.

### Season theme question
> **If numbers are inventions… why do they control reality?**

### Macro-plot
The hero settlement keeps nearly collapsing because it cannot:
- count reliably
- measure reliably
- store truth reliably
- run fair systems reliably

A surviving robot proposes:
> “Before we rebuild machines, we must rebuild numbers.”

### Season structure rule (maps book → missions)
> Each episode is built from the chapter’s hook/metaphor:
> a mission reproduces the hook as a real crisis,
> the characters invent the concept,
> then misuse/twist shows the cliff.

Example alignment:
- **1.1 Counting & Measuring:** returning team cannot prove everyone is back → pebbles/state; then measuring continuous resources
- **1.2 Place Value & Zero:** “nightmare of sticks” when inventory becomes huge; zero as placeholder prevents fatal accounting errors
- **1.3 Binary:** flashlight/switch comms and relay logic become necessary for night missions and relic interfaces
- **1.4 Overflow:** fixed-size counters/locks roll over and “warp reality” → modular arithmetic as literal danger

### Reliquary (optional recurring season object)
A sealed Old World artifact (vault/tower/control console) recurring through Season 1.
It cannot be forced.
It responds only to correct numeric thinking.
(Use if it strengthens continuity; missions still work without it.)

---

## 5) Conflict Model (high-level)
### Protagonist
A mixed team (humans + robots), rebuilding computation *without rebuilding old tyranny.*

### Core antagonist theme
> **Optimization without humanity**  
Efficiency becoming control / surveillance / dictatorship.

### Episode micro-conflict (required)
Every episode must contain one fight:
- shortcut vs correctness
- emotion vs logic
- “who owns knowledge”
- “who controls measurement”
- superstition vs proof
- tribal myth vs system truth

---

## 6) Episode format: **Episode = Chapter**
For this project:
- **Episode = Chapter** (one CS topic per episode)
- each episode must be standalone, but tied to the season overplot

---

## 7) Episode timing specifications (target: 5 minutes)
### Runtime target
- acceptable: **3–6 minutes**
- target: **~5:00 minutes**

### Required pacing (hard constraints)
- **Cold open joke:** 0:00–0:20  
- **Problem / stakes:** 0:20–1:00  
- **Core lecture + demo:** 1:00–3:45 *(education is the product)*  
- **Misuse / twist / consequence:** 3:45–4:40  
- **Ending punchline + sting:** 4:40–5:00  

### Theory vs story ratio
- **60–70% theory**
- **30–40% adventure**

Rule:
> If the episode works as a lesson without the story, it’s correct.

---

## 8) Script writing workflow (step-by-step, top-to-bottom)
Each episode must be built in stages (no “final script first”).

### Step 1 — Concept + Logline (2–5 lines)
- one-sentence episode idea
- one-sentence CS promise (“viewer understands X”)
- one-sentence ending sting

### Step 2 — Beat Outline (timestamped)
- 5-minute structure with timestamps
- no dialogue yet

### Step 3 — Treatment (1–2 pages)
- scene-by-scene prose
- what the viewer sees
- where diagrams appear
- exact CS points to cover from chapter

### Step 4 — Draft 1 Script
- full dialogue + actions
- complete episode beginning-to-end

### Step 5 — Revision passes (fast, surgical)
- **Education pass:** accuracy + clarity
- **Pacing pass:** cut fat, fit ~5:00
- **Comedy pass:** friction-based jokes
- **Visual pass:** every key idea has a prop/diagram
- **Tone pass:** nihilism + heart (no school lecture vibe)

### Step 6 — Final Script Package
- final script
- diagram directions (1–2 frames)
- caption-ready lesson summary (3–5 lines)

---

## 9) Main Characters (placeholder; built in separate thread)
Core team:
- **2 robots**
- **3 humans**

Each character profile must include:
- role in the search group
- flaw (comedy + conflict generator)
- what they learn in Season 1
- relationship to superstition vs proof

---

## 10) How episode chats will work (knowledge transfer)
This chat = **Thread B** (series plot bible)

Each episode gets its own chat.
In every new episode chat, user will paste:
1) the **book content as MD** 
2) this **Movie Brief**
3) the **Episode Brief** (short, chapter-specific)

Then the model outputs Step 1 + Step 2 first, and proceeds only after approval.

---

## 11) Guiding principles (non-negotiable)
1) **Education is the product.**
2) **Plot exists to force attention and memory.**
3) **No skipping fundamentals.**
4) **Humans are meaning; robots are structure.**
5) **Every abstraction has a cost.**
